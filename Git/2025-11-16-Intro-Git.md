<h1> Introduction to Git </h1>

```console
What is Git?
# is a distributed version control system that allows developers and operation teams to colaborate and keep track of the changes made on a project.
# Git has two repositories -local and remote
# Local repo is your machine
# Remote repo is a centralize server.
# The remote repo can be use as a backup or when you work with a team.

Some use commands
git init
# Initialize the file to receive changes
git add . 
# Using -A will add all changed files to tracking
git commit -m "file name" 
# commit files
git status 
# Check the status of changes in the repository
git config --list 
# List configs of the git repo
git push origin master 
# Pushes it to remote repo
git log
#Shows the metadata of the commit file such as the hash, the author name, the commit date, and the commit message
git log --oneline
#shows all the logs in one line
git log --name-only
#Helps to see the changes made by users in the repo
git log -n 1
#Identify the person who made the last commit
git remote add origin <git sshurl> 
# Specifies upstream remote repo
git remote remove origin <git sshurl>
#Removes upstream repo
echo "change" >> file title
#modify the content of the file commited
git restore file name
#Use to restore the file to his initial stage before the commit
git restore --staged <file name>
#Remove a file to a staging area
.gitignore 
echo file name
#Prevent Git from tracking that file in future commits. Also that you need to be in the root of your repository
git rm --cached file name
#Remove a file and place it in the cache
sed -i '3d' file name
#Remove/delete a specific line in a file created. The number is the line that you try to delete.
git branch 
#List all branches
git branch (branch name)
#Create a new branch
git checkout branchname
#Switch to an existing branch
git checkout -b 
#Create a new branch and switch to it
git branch -d username
#Delete a branch localy
git checkout master
#Allow you to go back to the master branch
git push --delete origin branch name
#Delete the branch remotly

```
