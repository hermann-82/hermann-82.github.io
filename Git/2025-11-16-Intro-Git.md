<h1> Introduction to Git </h1>

```console
What is Git?
# is a distributed version control system that allows developers and operation teams to colaborate and keep track of the changes made on a project.
  Git has two repositories -local and remote
  Local repo is your machine
  Remote repo is a centralize server.
  The remote repo can be use as a backup or when you work with a team.

Some use commands
git add . 
# Using -A will add all changed files to tracking
git commit -m "file name" 
# commit files
git status 
# Check the status of changes in the repository
git config --list 
# List configs of the git repo
git push orign master 
# Pushes it to remote repo
git remote add origin <git sshurl> 
# Specifies upstream remote repo
git remote remove origin <git sshurl>
#Removes upstream repo
```
